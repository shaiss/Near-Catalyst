# 🚀 Local Models Setup Complete

## ✅ Changes Made

Your NEAR Catalyst Framework has been updated to use your local models from `/Users/Shai.Perednik/.lmstudio/models` instead of downloading them again.

### 1. **Configuration Updates**
- **`config/config.py`**: Added `local_models_path` configuration (reads from environment variable only)
- **`agents/model_manager.py`**: Enhanced to load from local paths with proper directory mapping
- **`.env`**: Added `LOCAL_MODELS_PATH` with your actual models directory
- **`.env.example`**: Added placeholder path for documentation

### 2. **Model Mapping Applied**
Your local models are now mapped as follows:

| OpenAI Model | Local Model | File Path |
|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| `gpt-4.1` | `qwen2.5-72b-instruct` | `Qwen/Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct-GGUF/` (multi-file) |
| `o3` | `deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b` | `lmstudio-community/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B-GGUF/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B-Q4_K_M.gguf` |
| `o4-mini` | `deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b` | Same as above |

## ✅ Security Best Practices Applied

- **🔒 No Hardcoded Paths**: The actual models path is only in your `.env` file
- **📝 Documentation**: `.env.example` contains placeholder for team members
- **🛡️ Environment Isolation**: Configuration reads from environment variables only

## 📊 Model Status

Based on your local directory scan:

### ✅ Ready to Use
- **DeepSeek R1 Distill 32B** (Q4_K_M quantization) - Complete and ready
- **DeepSeek R1 Distill 7B** (Q4_K_M quantization) - Complete and ready

### ⚠️ In Progress
- **Qwen 2.5 72B Instruct** (Q2_K quantization) - Still downloading (part 4 of 7)
  - 6 of 7 files complete
  - 1 file still downloading: `downloading_qwen2.5-72b-instruct-q2_k-00004-of-00007.gguf.part`

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Automatic Path Detection**: When loading models, the system checks if local files exist
2. **Direct Loading**: If found locally, loads directly from your path (no download)
3. **Graceful Fallback**: If local files missing, falls back to identifier-based loading
4. **Smart Directory Handling**: 
   - Single files: Loads specific `.gguf` file
   - Multi-file models: Points to directory (LM Studio SDK handles the parts)

## 🧪 Testing

Test with the DeepSeek model (should work immediately):

```bash
# Test the DeepSeek model
python -c "
import asyncio
from agents.model_manager import get_model_manager

async def test():
    manager = get_model_manager()
    success = await manager.ensure_model_loaded('o3')
    print(f'DeepSeek model loading: {\"✅ Success\" if success else \"❌ Failed\"}')

asyncio.run(test())
"
```

## 📈 Expected Benefits

- **💰 Cost Savings**: $0.00006/token (o3) → Free
- **⚡ Faster Loading**: No downloads, direct local access
- **🔒 Privacy**: Models run entirely locally
- **🚀 Performance**: Optimized for your hardware

## 🔍 What's Next

1. **Wait for Qwen Download**: Let the remaining Qwen model file finish downloading
2. **Test DeepSeek**: Use reasoning agents with the available DeepSeek model  
3. **Full Testing**: Once Qwen completes, test general research agents

Your system is now configured to use local models efficiently and securely! 🎉
