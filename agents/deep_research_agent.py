Deep Research Agent for NEAR Catalyst Framework

This agent conducts deep, analyst-level research on potential hackathon partners using
LiteLLM Router with automatic local model routing and fallbacks. It builds upon the general 
research to create comprehensive reports at the level of a research analyst.

Features:
- Uses o4-mini for cost-effective deep research
- GPT-4.1 priming to enhance research quality
- Background mode for long-running analysis
- Isolated functionality for future model expansion
- LiteLLM Router with automatic fallbacks
